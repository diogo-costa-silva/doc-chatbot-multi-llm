# System-level packages for Hugging Face Spaces
# ================================================
# This file specifies system packages to be installed via apt-get on Hugging Face Spaces.
# These are OS-level dependencies, separate from Python packages (requirements.txt).
#
# IMPORTANT: This file is currently empty because our app only requires Python packages.
# All necessary dependencies are already defined in requirements.txt.
#
# When to add packages here:
# - Binary libraries required by Python packages (e.g., libpoppler for advanced PDF processing)
# - System utilities needed at runtime (e.g., tesseract-ocr for OCR)
# - Native tools for file processing (e.g., ffmpeg for media files)
#
# Format:
# - One package name per line
# - Use standard Debian/Ubuntu apt package names
# - Comments start with #
#
# Common examples (currently not needed, but kept for reference):
# libpoppler-cpp-dev  # Advanced PDF processing (beyond PyPDF capabilities)
# tesseract-ocr       # OCR text extraction from images
# tesseract-ocr-eng   # English language data for Tesseract
# ffmpeg              # Audio/video processing
# imagemagick         # Image manipulation
# ghostscript         # PostScript/PDF rendering
#
# Note: git, curl, wget are already included in HF Spaces by default
# Our project uses PyPDF which is pure Python and doesn't require system dependencies
